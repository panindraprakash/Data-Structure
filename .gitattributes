                                                  Welcome To Data Structures

* Data Structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer which can be accessed and modified efficiently.

* Linked list is a linear data structure,they are not stored at contiguous location unlike arrays but the elements are linked using pointers.

* Advantages Of Linked list
01 Dynamic Size ( We can add elements Dynamicaly,Unlike in Array we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance.)
02 Easy of Insertion and Deletion ( Using Pointer as link we can easly add or delete elements in between but in Array to Inserting a new element room has to be created,To create room existing elements have to shifted)

* Drawbacks
01 Random access is not allowed,We have to start from first Node so Binary Search is not possible ( In Array using index random acces is possible)
02 Extra Memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.

* Types of Linked List 
01 Single   Linked List
02 Doubly   Linked List
03 Circular Linked List
